# Open Portal 

> *A gateway to knowledge for the digital world.*

Open portals provide a way to organize and explore open resources and digital commons databases, a place to access open
models and gather openly shared knowledge tools. A new generation of databases to build search engines for digital commons.

**Development stage:** Still at the concept stage with this primitive proof of concept.

**Education:** To learn more about these dynamics, visit the [knowledge base on open models](https://open-models.org).

## Portal Installation

A portal can be deployed to create your own database of open resources. Follow the [installation instructions](installation.md)

## Community

Open Portal is managed collaboratively on [GitHub](https://github.com/Open-Models/Portal), see [contribution guidelines](contribute.md)
